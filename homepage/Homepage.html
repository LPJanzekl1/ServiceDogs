            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>This is a website dedicated to providing well organized, concise, and friendly information about the process of getting and owning a service dog for medical disabilities in the USA.  While the process of getting a service dog is different for everyone, key specific parts are the same: such as the ADA laws about service dogs, how to find a reputable trainer, the costs of a service dog, tasks a service dog can perform, and more.</p>

            <h2 id="introH">What is a Service Dog?</h2>
            <p id="training">A Service Dog is a working dog that provides necessary medical aid to it's handler. This can be in the form of providing stability for a physically disabled person, reacting or alerting to a medical event; such as a Seizure, and many other tasks. A Service Dog is considered a necessary 'medical equipment' and is recognized by the ADA for their ability to aid disabled people.

            <h2 id="introH">What is the difference between an ESA and a Service Dog? <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Mali:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet"></h2>
            <p id="training">An ESA, also known as an Emotional Support Animal, is a untrained animal that provides emotional and mental support for the owner of the animal. ESAs may be any type of animal, as long as the bond between them and their owner helps the owner's physical and/or mental state. In comparision, a Service Dog is considered a task trained dog of any size and breed. The tasks of a Service Dog help mitigate medical disabilities of their handlers. They are socially trained to be non-reactive in any and all social, public, or private spaces. They are considered 'medical equipment', and as such are allowed in public spaces, while ESAs must remain in the private residency of their owner.

            <h2 id="introH">How should a Service Dog act and look? <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Mali:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet"></h2>
    
            <p id="training">A Service Dog can be of any breed, size, or shape. The differences in how a Service Dog looks may depend on the type of tasks it needs to perform. For example, a Mobility Service Dog will need to be big enough to help balance and support their handler, while a Medical Alert Service Dog can be as small as a Chihuaha since alerting is not dependent on the size rather than their ability to sense the changes within their handler. <Br> While the breed of choice is up to the handler, the actions of the Service Dog in public must be consistant. The Service Dog should disregard any and all distractions around them, soley focusing on their handler and the tasks they were trained to perform. They must be leashed at all times, quiet unless alerting to a medical condition, demonstrate no aggresive tendencies, and should be housebroken.<Br> A Service Dog is currently not required to wear a harness that identifies it as a Service Dog, however many handlers choose to do so since the public tend to react nicer to a harnessed Service Dog. Similarly, within The United States, there are no registrations required of a Service Dog. This is a common misconception due to many fake sites claiming to register a Service Dog, however the ADA states that this is not required and is currently not being done legally.<Br> Overall, a Service Dog can take many shapes and forms, with the baseline being their ability to correctly perform their tasks and act appropriate in public.
