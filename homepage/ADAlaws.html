<h2>Airplane Transportation</h2> <img id="headingmyznik" src="Assets/myznik-egor-DhzREWUtKUw-unsplash.jpg"alt="Side Profile of a male handler standing with his Service Dog at a trainstation">
<p id="fontsize">The Air Carrier Access Act, protects the rights of disabled people during airline flights, including the rights of Handlers and their Service Dogs.  It is a law that makes it illegal for airlines to discriminate against passengers because of their disability. The Department of Transportation is responsible for enforcing the ACAA, which applies to all flights to, from, or within the United States (transportation.gov).<br>Handlers may be required to fill out documentation prior to their flight. Such as: <br><br> (1) a U.S. DOT form attesting to the animal's health, behavior, and training; and
    <br><br>(2) a U.S. DOT form attesting that the animal can either not relieve itself or can relieve itself in a sanitary manner, if the animal will be on a flight that is 8 or more hours.<br><br>Requirements may change for international flights and other international forms of transportation.  </p>

<h2>Housing</h2> <img id="headingleo" src="Assets/ralph-ravi-kayden-bjU0FvDuHJA-unsplash.jpg" alt="Tan and white poodle wearing yellow Service Dog vest">
<p id="fontsize">The ADA & Fair Housing Act provide support and protection for people with disabilites. This covers the provision of necessary medical equipment. In most cases, Service Dogs fall under this protection and are not allowed to be prohibited from any living situation. In some housing situations, the Handler may be required to provide a doctor's letter stating the need of a Service Dog, and/or explain the tasks their Service Dog performs to mitigate their disability.</p>

<h2>Public Spaces</h2> <img id="headingmyznik" src="Assets/jon-grogan-yfTFo4iaADI-unsplash.jpg" alt="Young lady handler sitting with her Sheperd Service Dog">
<p id="fontsize">As per the ADA (Americans With Disabilities Act), “state and local governments, businesses, and nonprofit organizations that serve the public generally must allow service animals to accompany people with disabilities in all areas of the facility where the public is allowed to go” (ADA.gov). 
    This includes, and is not limited to, parks, zoos, malls, restaurants, hospitals and small businesses. In cases like a zoo or a hospital, there may be some restrictions. These restrictions are in place to prevent unnecessary harm to others; such as a Service Dog potentially contaminating sterile environments of the burn unit or surgery center of a hospital. Similarly, the ADA states that “a person with a disability cannot be asked to remove his service animal from the premises unless: <br><br>(1) the dog is out of control and the handler does not take effective action to control it or <br><br>(2) the dog is not housebroken”</p>

    <h2>Questioning A Handler</h2>
<p id="fontsize">There are only two questions a staff or business can legally ask a handler about their Service Dog. These questions are: 
<br><br>
    (1) Is the dog a service animal required because of a disability? 
    <br>
    (2) What work or task has the dog been trained to perform? 
<br><br>
    Any other information given out by the handler should be of their own will and should be only as much as they are willing to disclose to others. </p>
