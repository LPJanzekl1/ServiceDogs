    <h2 id="intro">Selecting A Service Dog:
        <br> What to look for in your dog</h2>
    <p id="p1">Each dog has an individual personality, which determines their eligibility as a good service dog. Good traits to look for in your future Service Dog include behaviors such as: being calm & friendly to strangers, willing to work for a food reward, and an ability to focus on their handler despite environmental distractions. Conversly, traits to look for that would disqualify a dog from becoming a Service Dog include: acting fearful in public, being loud & disruptive, and having a 'work shy' personality that shows they are not motivated to perform their tasks.</p>

    <h2 id="h2">Good Personality Traits</h2>
    <p id="good">=================================================================================</p>
        <div id="flex">
            <div>
        <h2>Willingness To Work</h2>
        <p id="training">A dog that's willing to work makes all the difference in the world. On both good and bad days, your dog should want to work with you, and makes learning tasks easier.</p>
        </div>

        </div>
        <div id="flex">
        <div>
        <h2>Ability To focus</h2>
        <p id="training">Having the ability to focus will allow your dog to perform tasks in public spaces that will be noisy and distracting. Your dog should be able to focus completely on you and your needs, ignoring all other environmental factors.</p>
        </div>
        <video controls src="Assets/Ability to focus.mp4"></video>
        </div>
        <div id="flex">
        <div>
        <h2>Food Motivated</h2>
        <p id="training">A food motivated dog will be easier to train, since they will be willing to work for a food reward. This can be used even after your dog is completely trained as a continuous positive re-enforcment.</p>
        </div>
        <video controls src="Assets/Food Motivated.mp4"></video>
        </div>
    <h2 id="h2">Bad Personality Traits</h2>
    <p id="bad">=================================================================================</p>
        <div id="flex">
        <div>
        <h2>Loud & Disruptive</h2>
        <p id="training">A dog that acts loud and disruptive will be a nuisance to others in both public and private situations. There may also be a underlying behavioral problem with a loud and disruptive dog that training will not be able to fix.</p>
        </div>
        <video controls src="Assets/loud-disruptive.mp4"></video>
        </div>
        <div id="flex">
        <div>
        <h2>Inactive & Work Shy</h2>
        <p id="training">An inactive and/or work shy dog will be harder to train, unwilling to perform many tasks, and overall will be unhappy being a Service Dog. You want to make sure your dog actually enjoys working, and has the ability to work long hours by your side.</p>
        </div>
        <video controls src="Assets/Work-shy-inactive.mp4"></video>

        <div>
        <h2>Fealful & Aggressive</h2>
        <p id="training">A fearful and/or aggressive dog will not make a good Service Dog. They are too reactive to their surroundings, and react in a negative way. These types of dogs may also become a safety hazard to others, and will be disruptive.</p>
